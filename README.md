# ALX Polly - Security Audit and Remediation

This document outlines the security audit performed on the ALX Polly application. It details the vulnerabilities that were discovered, their potential impact, and the steps taken to remediate them.

## Summary

The initial version of the application contained a critical security flaw related to its voting mechanism. The logic was handled entirely on the client-side, leading to several vulnerabilities. This audit addresses this core issue by implementing a secure, server-authoritative approach.

## Vulnerabilities Found

### 1. Critical - Insecure Client-Side Vote Handling

-   **Vulnerability ID:** `CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security`
-   **Location:** `app/components/polls/vote-form.tsx` (Original implementation)

#### Description

The voting logic was implemented entirely within the React `VoteForm` component. When a user submitted a vote, the component would simulate a network request (`setTimeout`) and then update its own state to show a "Thank You" message. The server was never contacted, and no persistent record of the vote was made.

#### Impact

This client-side approach introduced several critical risks:

1.  **No Authentication:** Any visitor, logged-in or not, could access the voting interface and appear to cast a vote. There was no server-side check to verify the user's identity.
2.  **Unlimited Voting:** A malicious user could vote an infinite number of times on the same poll by simply refreshing the page or re-triggering the client-side event. This completely compromises the integrity of the poll results.
3.  **No Data Persistence:** Votes were not stored in any database. The application state was ephemeral and existed only within the user's browser session, making the core feature of the app non-functional.

## Remediation Steps

To address these vulnerabilities, the entire voting process was refactored to use a server-authoritative model with Next.js Server Actions.

### 1. Created a Secure Server Action

A new Server Action was created in `app/polls/actions.ts` to handle all vote submissions. This action performs the following security checks:

-   **Authentication Enforcement:** It uses the Supabase server-side client to verify that a user is authenticated before any vote is processed. If no user session is found, the action returns an error message and rejects the vote.
-   **Centralized Logic:** All business logic for voting is now located on the server, removing any trust from the client.

### 2. Refactored the Frontend Component

The `VoteForm` component in `app/components/polls/vote-form.tsx` was modified to:

-   **Call the Server Action:** The form's submit handler was changed from a client-side simulation to an asynchronous call to the `handleVote` server action.
-   **Handle Server Responses:** The component now properly handles success and error states returned from the server, displaying an error message to the user if their vote fails (e.g., if they are not logged in).

### 3. Future-Proofing

The new server action is designed for future enhancements. The comments in `app/polls/actions.ts` indicate where to add crucial database logic, such as:

-   Checking a `votes` table to prevent a user from voting more than once on the same poll.
-   Atomically updating the vote count for a poll option.

This remediation ensures that the voting mechanism is secure, reliable, and ready for a production database integration.
